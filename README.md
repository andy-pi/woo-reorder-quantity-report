# WooCommerce Reorder Quantity Report

## Description
WooCommerce already has a [Product Sales Report](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-sales-report-for-woocommerce/), and a section in WooCommerce on which products are low / out of stock.  
However, if you re-order on a regular basis, like my e-commerce website [Fix My Mech Hanger](https://fixmymechhanger.co.uk), it's handy to be able to automatically calculate the re-order quantity based on your previous period's sales and your current stock for all items, that's what this plugin does.   

## Installation  

1. Download this repo  
2. zip -r woo-reorder-quantity-report.zip swoo-reorder-quantity-report  
3. Upload woo-reorder-quantity-report.zip in your WordPress plugins dashboard
